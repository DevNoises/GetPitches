## Draws Pitch
I was using this app on my phone called VocalPitch-Monitor. I wanted to use it on my desktop but couldn't find something. I also wanted to be able to freeze the current pitches but still show new stuff but I couldn't do that. Maybe the paid version has that functionality. Anyways slapped this together using some open source stuff on github.

### External stuff used
fenster:   window stuff and drawing  
miniaudio: to get audio input data  
Yin:       to solve for the pitch

#### What the app doing?
Reads in audio, determines the pitch, then draws the ouput to the window.  
Can freeze the current window output. 5 can be saved. Can toggle showing this.
